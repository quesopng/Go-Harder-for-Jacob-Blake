          What Happened to Jacob Blake?

        <p id="whatPara">
          Although there are some details still unknown, as Blake was walking to
          his car after breaking up a dispute between two women, Kenosha police
          officers grabbed him from the back and shot him seven times in the
          back while his children looked on.

          Why Should I Care About Jacob Blake?
        </h1>
        <p id="whyPara">
          We should care about what happened because it demonstrates police
          brutality in the United States. Unfortunately, what happened to Jacob
          Blake happens to many other black people in the US. By bringing
          attention to this crime, we can push for a future where the injustices
          commited against Blake are not commited to anyone else.
