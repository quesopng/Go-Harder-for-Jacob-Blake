        A great way to enact change and demand accountability is to make phone
        calls to officials. Below, you'll find phone numbers of Kenosha
        officials to call.

      <p>     Hello,
        My name is (your name) and I am calling to demand justice for Jacob
        Blake. Jacob Blake is currently in critical condition and fighting for
        his life after Kenosha police shot him 7 times in front of his three
        young children. This is inhumane, unacceptable, and representative of
        the deep rooted racism and police brutality within our community.
      </p>
      <p>
             As a resident of (your city, state) , I am demanding that all police
        officers involved in the shooting be fired immediately and that the
        Kenosha District Attorney file appropriate charges and prosecute those
        involved to the fullest extent of the law. I am asking you to use your
        position of power to do what is best for the community and to do what is
        best for the Blake family. I am counting on you to act now.
      </p>
      <p>     In Solidarity, (your name).</p>
